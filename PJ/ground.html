            <p>2024 Ground control, I lover her very much she knows</p>
            <p>W/ Rosita Botti and Federico Russo</p><br>


            <p> Inspired by Giancarlo De Carlo's Collegis in Urbino, we initially developed a science fiction story for a short film. After completing the film, we began working on a manifesto to promote it. We designed two styles: the first, a geometric type influenced by De Carlo's architectural forms, and the second, more organic, reflecting nature and the human body. A key theme in De Carlo's architecture—the continuous relationship between inside and outside—also shapes the plot of the film.<br><br>
                
                In the dystopian future of Urbino, Miriam, a mysterious figure adorned with silver tendrils, is trapped within the abandoned collegi. Her only sustenance comes from the wildflowers that flourish amidst the ruins. A timer governs her movements, signaling when she can emerge to gather food. Each day, Miriam ventures out to hidden gardens where vibrant blooms offer her brief moments of solace. Surrounded by decay, she experiences fleeting peace, though her isolation weighs heavily on her.<br><br>

                The film’s title, "Ground Control, I Love Her Very Much She Knows," reflects Miriam's relationship with nature. The "she" in the title refers to nature itself—something Miriam loves deeply but remains disconnected from. This disconnection is further symbolized through the two typefaces in the manifesto: the organic type represents nature, fluid and alive, while the geometric type stands for architecture, symbolizing control and confinement. The tension between these elements mirrors Miriam's struggle, as she remains trapped inside the architectural remnants of the collegi, unable to fully connect with the natural world she longs for.</p>
