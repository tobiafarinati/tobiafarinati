                [IT] “Dentro di me vivono la mia identica vita
dei microrganismi che non sanno di appartenere
al mio corpo. Io a quale corpo appartengo?”<br>
[ENG] “Inside me live my identical life some
microorganisms that do not know that
they belong to my body. Which body
do I belong to?”<br>
A quote by Franco Battiato in “beta”.<br><br>
Human traces in form of trash can be found in all human
surroundings. They can give details about the place and
time and tell stories about the human relation they once
had. When picked up and analyzed, they become a relict of
our human living. While walking we developed a sincere
interest in these relicts. Through collecting, analyzing
and documenting them, their existence, form, structure
and relation to each other became the focus of our project.
They also turned into an intuitive instrument for creativi-
ty by using them as tools to paint and draw or as tools to
build compositions. They developed into a creative outlet,
a creative treasure.
One man’s trash is another man’s treasure.“
Through the process of exploring sites and the analysis of
the human relicts we recognized a similarity to archeaoli-
gst‘s work. This recognition then developed into the core
part of our format and style in the projects output.
